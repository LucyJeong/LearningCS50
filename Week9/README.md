- SQL :
To solve this problem of managing data, there exists SQL, Structured Query Language.
- SQL operation: `CREATE` `INSERT` `DELTE` `UPDATE` `SELECT`
- properties : `PRIMARY KEY` `INDEX` `Not NULL` `UNIQUE` `FOREIGN KEY`
- SQL Injection attack

## Voca
- leverage : í™œìš©
  - we didn't really __leverage__ mush if any, of a model
- robust : íŠ¼íŠ¼í•œ
  - That doesn't feel very __robust__.
- redundant : ìž¥í™©í•œ
  - This would seem __redundant__
- anticipate : ê¸°ëŒ€í•˜ë‹¤
  - it's not much __anticipate__ change...

## etc
- [SQL Injection](https://namu.wiki/w/SQL%20injection#rfn-1)
- I realized that Why an object-relational mapping (ORM) is needed in programming.
